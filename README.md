# Sapling (sort of)

This code contains all of the primitives and logic necessary to decrypt Sapling note outputs using an exported viewing key. It was intended as the start of a project to provide [webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) for Zcash payments, but I'm unlikely to continue that work as the upcoming NU5 (currently called Orchard) is slated to replace all of this with a new set of primitives and likely other breaking changes.

If you're interested in completing the project, I'm happy to answer questions and I suggest pursuing a [ZOMG](https://zcashomg.org) grant to fund ongoing maintenance. There's desire for this among people who would like to use Zcash for ecommerce and viewing keys give Zcash a unique affordance for the purpose.
